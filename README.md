This project is all about the one of the recent concept growing in AI industry which is MCP ( Model Context Protocol ).

I have implemented an MCP server using Spring boot which exposes couple of custom API's.

The API's are :

**1. Get current weather for the city
2. Forecast data for the city
3. City information
4. Fetch city information either by ID or Name
5. Delete city information**

Once implementation is done, just clean and package in order to get the JAR for the application.
Please refer to **application.properties** file contains more important information about MCP configuration and other details.

Each exposed API will registed as a Tool in MCP server. We have to do a MCP server information the below mentioned file available inside the Claude application.

**File name : claude_desktop_config.json**
